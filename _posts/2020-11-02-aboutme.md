I am currently a joint Ph.D. candidate of **[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)** and **[Peng Cheng Laboratory](https://data-starcloud.pcl.ac.cn/zh)** since 2021, advised by **[Prof. Ronggang Wang](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2147.htm)**.

Before that, I received the M.S. degree of Mechanical Engineering from **[Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/)** in 2019. Prior to that, I graduated from **[Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/)** in 2016.

My research interest focuses on human-centric 3D vision, including 3D human representation, novel view synthesis, etc.
